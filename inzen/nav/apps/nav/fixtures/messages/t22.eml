Thanks all. This is most encouraging.

Etgryphon, am waiting for the video to load, my internet is horribly
slow, though the good thing is that it has put me off Youtube, hurrah
for that!

Alexis, wonderful point, though we really like the fact (though not
experimented with as yet) that you can use other libraries with SC, we
hope to use CSS3 and (where relevant), jquery. Not bothered about
touch as yet as thats not part of the plan for the time being. Our web
application is mainly geared towards desktop and laptop users and we
are (atleast initially) not focusing on the smartphone (is this term
even relevant anymore?) crowd.

Best,
Salman

One of the developers (who was really struggling with SC) is also
looking into Dojo js framework.

We'll keep on reading up on SC and take it a step at a time.

All the best,
Salman
