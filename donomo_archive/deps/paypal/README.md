Django PayPal
=============


About
-----

Django PayPal is a pluggable application that implements with PayPal Payments Standard and Payments Pro.

Before diving in, a quick review of PayPal's payment methods is in order! [PayPal Payments Standard](https://cms.paypal.com/cms_content/US/en_US/files/developer/PP_WebsitePaymentsStandard_IntegrationGuide.pdf) is the "Buy it Now" buttons you may have
seen floating around the internets. Buyers click on the button and are taken to PayPal's website where they can pay for the product. After completing the purchase PayPal makes an HTTP POST to your  `notify_url`. PayPal calls this process [Instant Payment Notification](https://cms.paypal.com/cms_content/US/en_US/files/developer/PP_OrderMgmt_IntegrationGuide.pdf) (IPN) but you may know it as [webhooks](http://blog.webhooks.org). This method kinda sucks because it drops your customers off at PayPal's website but it's easy to implement and doesn't require SSL.

PayPal Payments Pro allows you to accept payments on your website. It contains two distinct payment flows - Direct Payment allows the user to enter credit card information on your website and pay on your website. Express Checkout sends the user over to PayPal to confirm their payment method before redirecting back to your website for confirmation. PayPal rules state that both methods must be implemented.


Using PayPal Payments Standard IPN:
-------------------------------

1. Download the code from GitHub:

        git clone git://github.com/johnboxall/django-paypal.git paypal

1. Edit `settings.py` and add  `paypal.standard.ipn` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

        # settings.py
        ...
        INSTALLED_APPS = (... 'paypal.standard.ipn', ...)

1.  Create an instance of the `PayPalPaymentsForm` in the view where you would like the custom to pay.
    Call `render` on the instance in your template to write out the HTML.

        # views.py
        ...
        from paypal.standard.forms import PayPalPaymentsForm
        
        def view_that_asks_for_money(request):
        
            # What you want the button to do.
            paypal_dict = {
                "business": "yourpaypalemail@example.com",
                "amount": "10000000.00",
                "item_name": "name of the item",
                "invoice": "unique-invoice-id",
                "notify_url": "http://www.example.com/your-ipn-location/",
                "return_url": "http://www.example.com/your-return-location/",
                "cancel_return": "http://www.example.com/your-cancel-location/",
            
            }
            
            # Create the instance.
            form = PayPalPaymentsForm(initial=paypal_dict)
            return render_to_response("payment.html", {"form":form})
            
            
        # payment.html
        ...
        <h1>Show me the money!</h1>
        {{ form.render }}

1.  When someone uses this button to buy something PayPal makes a HTTP POST to 
    your "notify_url". PayPal calls this Instant Payment Notification (IPN). 
    The view `paypal.standard.ipn.views.ipn` handles IPN processing. To set the 
    correct `notify_url` add the following to your `urls.py`:

        # urls.py
        ...
        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            (r'^something/hard/to/guess/', include('paypal.standard.ipn.urls')),
        )

1.  Whenever an IPN is processed a signal will be sent with the result of the 
    transaction. Connect the signals to actions to perform the needed operations
    when a successful payment is recieved.
    
    There are two signals for basic transactions:
    - `payment_was_succesful` 
    - `payment_was_flagged`
    
    And four signals for subscriptions:
    - `subscription_cancel` - Sent when a subscription is cancelled.
    - `subscription_eot` - Sent when a subscription expires.
    - `subscription_modify` - Sent when a subscription is modified.
    - `subscription_signup` - Sent when a subscription is created.

	You can connect to these signals and update your data accordingly [Django Signals Documentation](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/signals/).

        # models.py
        ...
        from paypal.standard.ipn.signals import payment_was_successful
        
        def show_me_the_money(sender, **kwargs):
            ipn_obj = sender
            # Undertake some action depending upon `ipn_obj`.
            if ipn_obj.custom == "Upgrade all users!":
                Users.objects.update(paid=True)        
        payment_was_successful.connect(show_me_the_money)
        
        
Using PayPal Payments Standard PDT:
-------------------------------

Paypal Payment Data Transfer (PDT) allows you to display transaction details to a customer immediately on return to your site unlike PayPal IPN which may take some seconds. [You will need to enable PDT in your PayPal account to use it.your PayPal account to use it](https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/howto_html_paymentdatatransfer).

1. Download the code from GitHub:

        git clone git://github.com/johnboxall/django-paypal.git paypal

1. Edit `settings.py` and add  `paypal.standard.pdt` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

        # settings.py
        ...
        INSTALLED_APPS = (... 'paypal.standard.ipn', ...)

1.  Create a view that uses `PayPalPaymentsForm` just like in PayPal IPN.

1.  After someone uses this button to buy something PayPal will return the user to your site at 
    your "return_url" with some extra GET parameters. PayPal calls this Payment Data Transfer (PDT). 
    The view `paypal.standard.pdt.views.pdt` handles PDT processing. to specify the correct
     `return_url` add the following to your `urls.py`:

        # urls.py
        ...
        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            (r'^paypal/pdt/', include('paypal.standard.pdt.urls')),
            ...
        )

Using PayPal Payments Standard with Subscriptions:
-------------------------------

1.  For subscription actions, you'll need to add a parameter to tell it to use the subscription buttons and the command, plus any 
    subscription-specific settings:

        # views.py
        ...
        paypal_dict = {
            "cmd": "_xclick-subscriptions",
            "business": "your_account@paypal",
            "a3": "9.99",                      # monthly price 
            "p3": 1,                           # duration of each unit (depends on unit)
            "t3": "M",                         # duration unit ("M for Month")
            "src": "1",                        # make payments recur
            "sra": "1",                        # reattempt payment on payment error
            "no_note": "1",                    # remove extra notes (optional)
            "item_name": "my cool subscription",
            "notify_url": "http://www.example.com/your-ipn-location/",
            "return_url": "http://www.example.com/your-return-location/",
            "cancel_return": "http://www.example.com/your-cancel-location/",
        }

        # Create the instance.
        form = PayPalPaymentsForm(initial=paypal_dict, button_type="subscribe")
        
        # Output the button.
        form.render()


Using PayPal Payments Standard with Encrypted Buttons:
------------------------------------------------------

Use this method to encrypt your button so sneaky gits don't try to hack it. Thanks to [Jon Atkinson](http://jonatkinson.co.uk/) for the [tutorial](http://jonatkinson.co.uk/paypal-encrypted-buttons-django/).

1. Encrypted buttons require the `M2Crypto` library:

        easy_install M2Crypto
    

1. Encrypted buttons require certificates. Create a private key:

        openssl genrsa -out paypal.pem 1024

1. Create a public key:

        openssl req -new -key paypal.pem -x509 -days 365 -out pubpaypal.pem

1. Upload your public key to the paypal website (sandbox or live).
        
    [https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_profile-website-cert](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_profile-website-cert)

    [https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_profile-website-cert](https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_profile-website-cert)

1.  Copy your `cert id` - you'll need it in two steps. It's on the screen where
    you uploaded your public key.

1. Download PayPal's public certificate - it's also on that screen.

1. Edit your `settings.py` to include cert information:

        # settings.py
        PAYPAL_PRIVATE_CERT = '/path/to/paypal.pem'
        PAYPAL_PUBLIC_CERT = '/path/to/pubpaypal.pem'
        PAYPAL_CERT = '/path/to/paypal_cert.pem'
        PAYPAL_CERT_ID = 'get-from-paypal-website'

1. Swap out your unencrypted button for a `PayPalEncryptedPaymentsForm`:

        # views.py
        from paypal.standard.forms import PayPalEncryptedPaymentsForm
        
        def view_that_asks_for_money(request):
            ...
            # Create the instance.
            form = PayPalPaymentsForm(initial=paypal_dict)
            # Works just like before!
            form.render()


Using PayPal Payments Standard with Encrypted Buttons and Shared Secrets:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This method uses Shared secrets instead of IPN postback to verify that transactions
are legit. PayPal recommends you should use Shared Secrets if:

    * You are not using a shared website hosting service. 
    * You have enabled SSL on your web server. 
    * You are using Encrypted Website Payments. 
    * You use the notify_url variable on each individual payment transaction.
    
Use postbacks for validation if: 
    * You rely on a shared website hosting service 
    * You do not have SSL enabled on your web server 

1. Swap out your button for a `PayPalSharedSecretEncryptedPaymentsForm`:

        # views.py
        from paypal.standard.forms import PayPalSharedSecretEncryptedPaymentsForm
        
        def view_that_asks_for_money(request):
            ...
            # Create the instance.
            form = PayPalSharedSecretEncryptedPaymentsForm(initial=paypal_dict)
            # Works just like before!
            form.render()
            
1. Verify that your IPN endpoint is running on SSL - `request.is_secure()` should return `True`!


Using PayPal Payments Pro
-------------------------

PayPal Payments Pro is the more awesome version of PayPal that lets you accept payments on your site. Note that PayPal Pro uses a lot of the code from `paypal.standard` so you'll need to include both apps. Specifically IPN is still used for payment confirmation. There is a fairly good [explanation of the WPP basics on the PayPal Forums](http://www.pdncommunity.com/pdn/board/message?board.id=wppro&thread.id=192).


1. Edit `settings.py` and add  `paypal.standard` and `paypal.pro` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`, also set your PayPal settings:

        # settings.py
        ...
        INSTALLED_APPS = (... 'paypal.standard', 'paypal.pro', ...)
        PAYPAL_TEST = True         # Start in Testing Mode
        PAYPAL_WPP_USER = ???      # Get from PayPal website!
        PAYPAL_WPP_PASSWORD = ???
        PAYPAL_WPP_SIGNATURE = ???


1. Write a view wrapper for `paypal.pro.views.PayPalPro` and add it to your `urls.py`:

        from paypal.pro.views import PayPalPro

        def buy_my_item(request):
            item = {'amt':"10.00",              # amount to charge for item
                    'inv':"inventory#",         # unique tracking variable paypal
                    'custom':"tracking#",       # custom tracking variable for you
                    'cancelurl':"http://...",   # Express checkout cancel url
                    'returnurl':"http://..."}   # Express checkout return url
        
        kw = {'item':'item',                            # what you're selling
               'payment_template': 'template',          # template to use for payment form
               'confirm_template': 'confirm_template',  # form class to use for Express checkout confirmation
               'payment_form_cls': 'payment_form_cls',  # form class to use for payment
               'success_url': '/success',               # where to redirect after successful payment
               }
        ppp = PayPalPro(**kw)
        return ppp(request)
        
        # urls.py
        
        urlpatterns = ('',
            ...
            (r'^payment-url/$', 'myproject.views.pro')
            ...
        )
        

1. Add the IPN endpoints to your `urls.py` to receive callbacks from PayPal.

1. Profit.

ToDo:
=====

* A a shared conf file for all settings.

* Shared Secrets: The implementation is untested.

* Query Fields: Lots of fields store QueryDict dumps b/c we're not sure exactly what we're getting - would be cool to be able to access those fields like they were a dict (JSONField)

* Feeds: Would also be awesome to have a feed of successful payments so you keep up to date with how rich you're getting.
